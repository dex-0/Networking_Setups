Documentation: Three-Tier Enterprise Network
Overview
A three-tier enterprise network design connecting two branches via a Cisco 2911 router, providing internet access with redundancy. All devices are dual-stack with IPv4 and IPv6, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

Routing Configuration
Routing Protocols:
OSPFv2 used for IPv4 dynamic routing within the internal network.
Static routing configured for the connection between the router and ISP.
NAT:
Dynamic NAT overload configured on the 2911 router for private IP address translation.
Virtual Interfaces:
Virtual interfaces configured as gateways for each subnet to enable inter-VLAN routing.
Device Access Security
Authentication:
Router (R1):
enable password secured using scrypt.
Local credentials: username cisco, password ccna.
Switches (Distribution, Core, Access):
Local credentials: username ccna, password ccna.
Remote Access:
SSHv2 configured to allow secure remote access, with Telnet disabled.
Network Security Features
Access Control:
ACLs configured to control traffic flow and restrict unauthorized access.
Switch Security:
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), DHCP Snooping, and Port Security applied for protection against malicious activities.
Unused ports disabled, end-device ports configured with PortFast and BPDU Guard for enhanced security.
Spanning Tree:
RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) used for fast convergence and loop prevention.
Switching Configuration
EtherChannel:
LACP configured for Layer 2 EtherChannels between access and distribution switches with trunking.
Layer 3 EtherChannels configured between core switches for efficient routing.
DHCP and DNS
DHCP:
DHCP pools configured on R1 to dynamically assign IP addresses to end devices.
DNS:
A dedicated DNS server configured to provide name resolution services across the network.
Wireless Configuration
WLC:
Management VLAN configured for the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
WLAN named Wi-Fi deployed for client access.
WPA2+PSK security configured for secure wireless access.
Time and Logging Services
NTP:
R1 acts as the NTP server at level 5, providing time synchronization across all devices.
SNMP and Syslog:
Syslog configured to send logs to an external server for centralized logging and monitoring.
SNMP configured for network monitoring.
Other Measures
Redundancy:
Critical points in the network configured with redundancy for enhanced reliability and failover.
Documentation and Consistency:
Proper hierarchy and standardized configurations maintained to ensure network stability and manageability.
This design provides a robust, secure, and scalable network solution with high availability and efficient management.
